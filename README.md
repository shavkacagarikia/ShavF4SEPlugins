# Description
Latest sources for my f4se plugins

# Notes
-Built using VS 2019(v142) platform toolset and windows SDK version 8.1.  
-After building the needed project, it will attempt to move .dll in Fallout 4 f4se plugins folder, it requires FALLOUT_DIR environment variable to be set to the path to your fallout 4 directory, if  you dont want to, just remove post-build event from the project settings.
