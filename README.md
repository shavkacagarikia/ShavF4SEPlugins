# Description
Latest sources for my f4se plugins updated for Next-Gen game version

**[Classic Holstered Weapons System (CHW)](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/46101)**  
**[Bullet Counted Reload System (BCR)](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/41178)**

# Notes
-Built using VS 2019(v142) platform toolset and windows SDK version 8.1.  
-After building the needed project, it will attempt to move the built .dll in Fallout 4 f4se plugins folder. That requires FALLOUT_DIR environment variable on your system to be set to the path to your fallout 4 directory, if you dont want to, just remove post-build event from the project settings.
